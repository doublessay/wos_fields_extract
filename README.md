## Extract the fields information from  web of science  
As you konw, Web of science is an abstract database, and we always need to export the records data to do some analysis.  
Sometimes we can use some applications, such as VOSviewer, directly but more limit.When we would like to analyse the data with personalized ideas, the first step is cleaning the data and extract useful fields.  
Congratulations! The repository is for you!

### There are some things to pay attention to before using the program.
- The file type you exported from web of science is "Plain Text File" .
- You are recommended to check the [fields description](wos_fields_extract/tree/master/Web of Science字段说明) before extracting the fields.
- If you have any question, please submit issues and I will try to solve the problem.
